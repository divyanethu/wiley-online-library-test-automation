The automated test cases focus on validating core functionalities like user login, search functionality, and browsing through categories. Each test is designed to interact with the application and verify that actions such as logging in with valid credentials, conducting searches based on keywords, and navigating categories return the expected results. These tests ensure that the application functions correctly and efficiently for the end user. The scripts are executed with Playwright, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and generating useful reports for issue tracking and resolution.
